    <h3>Scoping</h3>
    <p>When working with SmartLogic, the client is in the driver's seat. Our clients and their business needs determine the scope of the projects and the features that get built. From project commencement, scoping meetings allow us to jump headfirst into design and development, or results can be used for client fundraising and budget planning.</p>

    <h3>Design and Development</h3>
    <p>Whether we're your sole development resource or we're integrated with your in-house development team, we work to complete your prioritized features as efficiently as possible. You determine what gets done, and when. To ensure we're in alignment, we communicate throughout the course of the project through periodic scoping meetings, weekly iteration meetings, and daily standup meetings. All three serve to keep all stakeholders abreast of project progress.</p>

    <h3>Project Completion</h3>
    <p>We take great pride in the applications we help create and are with them for their product lifecycles. We help in-house development teams transition to code we've created and are available for maintenance or feature development in perpetuity.</p>
