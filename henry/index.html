    <p>
    Before SmartLogic, Henry co-founded the student review website <a href="http://ratemystudyabroad.com">RateMyStudyAbroad.com.</a> Among other adventures, he spent a year in a cottage attempting (and failing) to read the entire "Western Canon" starting with Plato. He loves writing code and thinking through interesting problems, especially ancient Greek ones. Henry writes about the Stoic school of philosophy at <a href="http://www.stoichacks.com">StoicHacks.com.</a> He lives in Germany, where he runs SmartLogic's Berlin office.
