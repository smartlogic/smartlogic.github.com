        <h2>What We Offer</h2>
        <p>At SmartLogic, we build custom web and mobile software applications. We can help with projects including <a href="/services/product-design">product design and research</a>, back-end development, <a href="/services/devops">DevOps configuration</a>, API development, user testing, and mobile application builds. </p>
        <p>We don't do CRM or marketing projects; there are plenty of great agencies around who can help you with that. We primarily focus on applications that handle business logic, either an internal process that a business wants to automate or a customer-facing product or feature.</p>
        <p>Much of our work is from the ground up, meaning we build new applications from scratch. Some of our clients have no techncial staff but need an internal or external tool built, and so we function as their de-facto technical team; others have a robust engineering department but need a project or feature turned around more quickly than they could manage in-house.

        <h2>Our History</h2>
        <p>SmartLogic was founded in 2005 by two Johns Hopkins Computer Science students, and over the years has grown to become a <a href="https://technical.ly/baltimore/2014/09/22/winners-baltimore-innovation-awards/">staple in the Baltimore tech community</a>, developing software for local startups and institutions alike. We developed an iPhone app <a href="/case-studies/spotcrime">before the App Store</a> and helped our clients understand "<a href ="https://www.bizjournals.com/baltimore/stories/2008/01/28/story3.html">the cloud</a>" back in 2008.</p>
        <p>We've been members of the <a href="https://www.etcbaltimore.com/">ETC community</a> since 2006. Our first office was at the old ETC Eastern building, and though we now work out of the Broom Factory in Canton, we are still very involved through mentorship with the strong entrepreneurial community at the ETC.
        <p>The technologies we use have evolved over the years. These days on the back end we still use <a href="/technologies/ruby-on-rails">Ruby on Rails</a> though we prefer to start new projects in <a href="/technologies/elixir-phoenix">Elixir/Phoenix</a>; for the front end, we use React for web projects and <a href="/technologies/react-native">React Native</a> for mobile, whether we're building a cross-platform or single-platform application.

        <h2>Community</h2>
        <p>We're proud to be a Baltimore company, and you'll find that many people in the local startup and technology communities know who we are.</p>
        <p>Civic engagement is one of our core company beliefs, and we've been engaged with a number of community initiatives over the years. We've been <a href="https://technical.ly/baltimore/2012/12/28/smartlogic-baltimores-tech-community-ate-3288-slices-of-pizza-in-2012-infographic/">sending pizza</a> to technical meetups in town since 2010, hosted the Ruby on Rails unconference <a href="http://bohconf.com/previous-years.html">BohConf</a> for several years, and have created a series of initiatives including <a href="/about/community/bwit/">microgrant</a> and <a href="/about/community/apprentice/">apprenticeship</a> programs.</p>
        <p>Our latest community projects are <a href="https://hackbaltimore.io/">Hack Baltimore</a> and our <a href="/about/community/ventures/">SmartVentures</a> initiative; we also recently partnered with our friends at Fearless to <a href="https://technical.ly/baltimore/2019/11/26/smartlogic-fearless-tech-companies-donate-giving-tuesday/">donate a total of $20,000</a> to four local nonprofits.
