  <!-- <h2 id="why-have-a-code-of-conduct-">Why have a Code of Conduct?</h2> -->
  <p>As contributors to the Elixir community, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of age, disability, gender, nationality, race, religion, sexuality, or similar personal characteristic.</p>
  <p>The goal of the Code of Conduct is to specify a baseline standard of behavior so that people with different social values and communication styles can talk about Elixir effectively, productively, and respectfully, even in face of disagreements. The Code of Conduct also provides a mechanism for resolving conflicts in the community when they arise.</p>
  <h2 id="our-values">Our Values</h2>
  <!-- <p>These are the values Elixir community members should aspire to:</p> -->
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Be friendly and welcoming</strong>  </li>
  <li><strong>Be patient</strong></li>
  <ul><li>Remember that people have varying communication styles and that not everyone is using their native language. (Meaning and tone can be lost in translation.)
  </li></ul>
  <li><strong>Be thoughtful</strong></li>
    <ul>
      <li>Productive communication requires effort. Think about how your words will be interpreted.
      </li>
      <li>Remember that sometimes it is best to refrain entirely from commenting.
      </li>
    </ul>
  <li><strong>Be respectful</strong>
  </li>
    <ul><li>In particular, respect differences of opinion. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively.
    </li></ul>
  <li><strong>Avoid destructive behavior</strong>
  </li>
  <ul><li>Derailing: stay on topic; if you want to talk about something else, start a new conversation.
  </li>
  <li>Unconstructive criticism: don&#39;t merely decry the current state of affairs; offer (or at least solicit) suggestions as to how things may be improved.
  </li>
  <li>Snarking (pithy, unproductive, sniping comments).
  </li></ul>
  </ul>
  <h3>The following actions are explicitly forbidden:</h3>
  <ul>
  <li>Insulting, demeaning, hateful, or threatening remarks.
  </li>
  <li>Discrimination based on age, disability, gender, nationality, race, religion, sexuality, or similar personal characteristic.
  </li>
  <li>Bullying or systematic harassment.
  </li>
  <li>Unwelcome sexual advances.
  </li>
  <li>Incitement to any of these.
  </li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="where-does-this-code-of-conduct-apply-">Where does this Code of Conduct apply?</h2>
  <p>If you participate in or contribute to the Elixir Wizards community in any way, you are encouraged to follow the Code of Conduct while doing so.</p>
  <p>Explicit enforcement of the Code of Conduct applies to the official mediums operated by the SmartLogic and the Elixir Wizards:</p>
  <ul>
  <li><p><a href=/about/community/elixir-wizards-conference/">The Elixir Wizards |&gt; Conference</a></p>
  </li>
  <li><p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/JGcqSaYf2a">The Elixir Wizards Discord</a></p>
  </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by emailing: <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#x6c;&#x74;&#111;&#x3a;&#99;&#x6f;&#x6e;&#x64;&#117;&#99;&#116;&#x40;&#115;&#109;&#97;&#114;&#116;&#108;&#x6f;&#103;&#105;&#x63;&#x2e;&#105;&#111;">&#99;&#x6f;&#x6e;&#x64;&#117;&#99;&#116;&#x40;&#115;&#109;&#97;&#114;&#116;&#108;&#x6f;&#103;&#105;&#x63;&#x2e;&#105;&#111;</a>, or texting or calling 410-709-8735. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. All reports will be kept confidential.</p>
  <p>The goal of the Code of Conduct is to resolve conflicts in the most harmonious way possible. We hope that in most cases issues may be resolved through polite discussion and mutual agreement. Bannings and other forceful measures are to be employed only as a last resort. Do not post about the issue publicly or try to rally sentiment against a particular individual or group.</p>
