        <h2>Will you help towards relocation costs?</h2>
        <p>No, we do not plan to contribute towards any potential relocation costs.</p>
        <h2>Are you going to run this program again?</h2>
        <p>We’re not sure. This is the first time we are running this program.</p>
        <h2>You’re just going to give $400k away?</h2>
        <p>Not exactly. You will not be receiving any cash. The investment is in the form of (1) contributions by SmartLogic’s highly capable product development team; and (2) Yair and Margaret’s time.</p>
        <h2>Isn’t this just an incubator? &nbsp</h2>
        <p>No. There is no cost to you.</p>
        <h2>Isn’t this just an accelerator? &nbsp</h2>
        <p>No. There is no educational component nor is there a cohort.</p>
        <h2>I don’t have revenue but I can attest that my company and I are exceptional. Can I still apply?</h2>
        <p>We are only considering companies that have revenue. But we can’t stop you from filling out a form and hitting the submit button.</p>
        <h2>Will you sell my data? &nbsp</h2>
        <p>Absolutely not. We will keep it in the strictest of confidence.</p>
        <h2>What can I expect after I apply?</h2>
        <p>We’re planning to review applications very soon after each of the three application dates and make determinations quickly thereafter. Though we reserve the right to select a winner sooner and furthermore we reserve the right to close the application at any time for any reason.</p>
        <p>We intend to conduct in-depth personal interviews (we will travel to you) with up to four finalists.</p>
        <h2>Who is on the selection committee?</h2>
        <p>TBD. At a minimum the selection committee will include Yair Flicker and Margaret Roth.</p>
        <h2>How long do I have to use the product development investment?</h2>
        <p>You will have 12 months from the date we execute an agreement. Yair and Margaret may stay on in a support role after the 12 month period ends.</p>
        <h2>I have another question. Who should I contact? &nbsp</h2>
        <p>Email Margaret Roth (<a href="mailto:margaret@smartlogic.io">margaret@smartlogic.io</a>) and Yair Flicker (<a href="mailto:yair@smartlogic.io">yair@smartlogic.io</a>).</p>
