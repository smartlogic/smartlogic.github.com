      <p>React JS is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces for web applications. Because it is declarative and component-based, ReactJS is a great tool for building interactive user interfaces that are easy to maintain and handle scale well.</p>
      <p>At SmartLogic, we’ve been using ReactJS since 2015 and have found React’s modular structure to be a great fit with the ways we think about user interface design. Reusable component-driven design provides scale and consistency when building a dynamic front end, and also fits well with our iterative development process.</p>
      <p>Our team of front end developers has built React interfaces for over a dozen applications, including responsive web forms, admin panels and reporting tools, a queueing system for remotely administered tests, a dynamic energy credits trading platform, a map-based crime search tool, and a multi-site volunteer scheduling tool.</p>
