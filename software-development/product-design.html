          <div class="casestudies__article-text-desc">
            <p>Our main goal when creating an empathy map is to align stakeholders and to establish a baseline user we are targeting when we move on to journey mapping. We conduct an empathy mapping session with clients and developers together, moving from market research to user characteristics. The completed empathy map in of itself is a great artifact and point of reference; we also use it to also create a proto-persona, which helps to anchor design and development around the user's needs and preferences.</p>

          <div class="casestudies__article-text-desc">
            <p>With a Journey Map, we define a set of steps a user takes to complete a goal along with several questions we ask as a team for each defined step, including pains, gains, what the user needs to move on to the next step, questions they have, how they’re feeling. We use the journey map to focus on the user’s journey, so we can make strong UX decisions. This is also an opportunity to shift focus from all the features the app could have to the features critical to the user’s ability to successfully complete a goal.</p>

          <div class="casestudies__article-text-desc">
            <p>We begin wireframing by building micro-wireframes in Whimsical; they are something of a cross between a user flow and an actual wireframe. Micro-wireframes allow us to start thinking about the interactions in each step without getting ahead of ourselves and putting too much detail into the layout, placement, and look and feel of each feature. Micro-wireframes are a great way to map out the screens we’ll need to design and the flows we want in a quick and iterative way. We move on from micro-wireframes to full wireframes and then mockups once we've built consensus with the client on what the final flows should be.</p>

          <div class="casestudies__article-text-desc">
            <p>Once we agree on a final version of the wireframes we move on to designing  high-resolution mockups in Sketch, and then an interactive screen-based prototype. We build prototypes in InVision, which allows for quick turnaround and iteration. The more we can test, clarify, and refine the design before beginning to code, the faster and more focused development can be; structural changes are relatively easy in a design tool and much more time-intensive (and costly) once the coding has started.</p>

      <h2>We test our (and your) assumptions early and often.</h2>

      <p>Our product design approach generally is to be agile where possible, iterate, do our discovery and test our assumptions whenever we can to minimize surprises during development. We help our clients go from concept to testable prototype through a collaborative process that focuses on testing and iteration.
