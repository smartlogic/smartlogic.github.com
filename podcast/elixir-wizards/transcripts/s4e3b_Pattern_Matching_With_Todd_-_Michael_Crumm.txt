Speaker 1:
Welcome to a special edition of Elixir Wizards. This episode, we're featuring a new segment we've been trying out called Pattern Matching with Todd. You may have heard one of these at the end of a normal season four episode. We wanted to try sharing them as standalone mini episodes as well, which is what you're hearing today.
Pattern matching is a short format interview where our friend Todd Resudek asks each guest the same five questions. We hope this segment helps you get to know members of the Elixir community a little bit better. Let us know how you like it, whether you prefer at the end of a normal episode or as a standalone mini episode. Please enjoy this episode of Elixir Wizards' Pattern Matching with Todd.

Todd Resudek:
Thank you for joining me today for this episode of Pattern Matching. My guest today may be best known for his work on the jest released Phoenix LiveDashboard, which I know a lot of people are very excited about, or you may have seen his talk on Broadway at Lonestar Elixir this year.
Taking time away from his duties at DockYard, welcome Michael Crumm.

Michael Crumm:
Hi Todd. Thanks for having me.

Todd Resudek:
It's great to have you here. Before we get to the standard five questions, I just want to take another chance to compliment you on the fine work with Phoenix LiveDashboard. We installed it on our app this week and we've got custom telemetry working now, and it's really, really fantastic. So, thank you and everybody else that was involved in making that happen.

Michael Crumm:
That's great to hear. Thank you so much. It was a super fun project to work on and it's been something that, I think, has been in the works for, at least in thought and idea for quite a while. So I was happy to be able to jump in and help out with that.

Todd Resudek:
Awesome. So, let's start out with the five questions. Where were you born?

Michael Crumm:
I was born in Galesburg, Illinois, which is kind of West Central. It's about equal distance between Chicago and St. Louis.

Todd Resudek:
Okay. Yeah, I was looking at it on the map, it looks like it's maybe somewhat close to the Quad Cities?

Michael Crumm:
Yes. Yes, absolutely. I think we chatted about that briefly at Lonestar, if I recall. But yeah, it's about an hour drive. We just drive everything in the Midwest, in terms of how long it takes you to get there, not in miles. But it's about an hour drive.

Todd Resudek:
Hour drive, okay. I also learned that Galesburg, Illinois is the birthplace of the Pulitzer Prize winning author, Carl Sandburg.

Michael Crumm:
That is true, that is true.

Todd Resudek:
Author, poet, thinker. So, that's very cool. Was there a big Carl Sandburg statue or a bust somewhere in the square?

Michael Crumm:
There are a few, here and there, a few things of that nature. The community college was named after Mr. Sandburg and one of his childhood homes is there and is a bit of a monument. Funnily enough, I've never been there. But yeah, he apparently at some point disowned Galesburg as well, he considered Chicago his hometown. So, that tells you how much people really talk about Galesburg.

Todd Resudek:
Oh, man.

Michael Crumm:
The inventor of the Ferris wheel is also from Galesburg, Illinois. A guy named George Ferris.

Todd Resudek:
Oh, that makes sense. I was going to ask if his name was Ferris.

Michael Crumm:
It was.

Todd Resudek:
All right.

Michael Crumm:
Yeah, I believe his family has a street named after them as well.

Todd Resudek:
Did he invent that for the St. Louis World's Fair?

Michael Crumm:
I have no idea.

Todd Resudek:
All right.

Michael Crumm:
It's one of those things I should know, but I cannot say.

Todd Resudek:
Okay, we'll look that up. I feel like it was built for one of the world fairs.

Michael Crumm:
That sounds right.

Todd Resudek:
So, we'll check it out. Yes, somebody's listening right now saying you idiot, 1896. Okay. So you were born in Galesburg and where are you living now?

Michael Crumm:
I am living in, just outside of Sacramento, California, and I've been here for about eight years.

Todd Resudek:
Okay. What brought you out to Sacramento?

Michael Crumm:
I moved here to take job with a company called Ground Control. We were doing a lot of services works, we did a lot of work in the music industry for VIP things, ticketing, merchandising, all kind of fun stuff like that. So, started out there and did that for a couple of years and then kind of jumped around to a few different startups in the San Quentin and Sacramento area. Did that for a little bit and then it was just about a year ago last July, took a position at DockYard.

Todd Resudek:
Very cool. Yeah, I've spent some time in Sacramento growing up and I don't think it gets enough credit. It's a pretty decent place. Approximate to Lake Tahoe and approximate to the Bay Area.

Michael Crumm:
Yeah, absolutely. Sacramento itself is a little, like I said, I did some work in the music industry, so it's a B market, right, you don't get the big acts necessarily. But yeah, super close to a lot of other fun things. My wife's big into skiing and stuff like that, so we get up to Tahoe when we can and go and hike and do all those kind of fun things. So, that's always fun and it's fun to go [inaudible 00:04:36]. Being from a tiny little town in the middle of a cornfield, it's always fun to go to San Francisco and just hang out for a little while and see what's going on.

Todd Resudek:
Yeah, it's nice to have the option to do it, but not have to do it if you don't want to.

Michael Crumm:
Yes, yes. I couldn't imagine living there, but it was fun to visit.

Todd Resudek:
Very cool. Well, cool, shifting gears here. Have you had any careers before you were a programmer?

Michael Crumm:
I think I mowed lawns for a while when I was in middle school and stuff, but no, my first job was at 15 as an internet service technician for an ISP in my hometown. So, that's where I started programming, as well as I do web programming and PHP. So, I considered writing for a little while. I thought about doing writing for television when I was in high school, and then [inaudible 00:05:21]. When I went back to college the second time, I considered going into film editing. I was a broadcasting major for a little while.
But I found myself more interested in trying to write Final Cut plugins, than actually edit film. So, that was a pretty big indicator that I was like, "No, I'm just going to go back to programming."

Todd Resudek:
That's interesting.

Michael Crumm:
Yeah.

Todd Resudek:
So you're self-taught then, I assume?

Michael Crumm:
Yeah, almost entirely. I mean, I've done some undergrad level work in CS, but no, none of it was really relevant to most of what I do now, or then even. So yeah, self-taught for ... I picked up a book on PHP 4, because another guy that I worked with at the time was making a web app and I thought that was just the coolest thing in the world, you could just build whatever you want. So yeah, started playing around with that and just kind of never looked back.

Todd Resudek:
Very cool. Yeah, I remember PHP 4 coming out, be very excited about having the class keyword. Even though it really wasn't an object, you could make your PHP look like it was object-oriented at the time.

Michael Crumm:
Right. Yeah, absolutely. I was so fresh to everything, that that all felt like voodoo to me. That was all magic and I had no idea what any of it meant. So funnily enough though now that you say that, when I first started looking at object-oriented programming, it was from the perspective of the Zend Framework. So it was kind of trying to teach myself both at the same time, for better or worse, right? That was the angle which I approached that stuff. So yeah, that was a long time ago, man.

Todd Resudek:
If you weren't a programmer, what do you think you'd end up being?

Michael Crumm:
That's a great question. Probably a writer, maybe. I think I would have tried to write and maybe been okay at it. Yeah, I don't know what format I would have taken, but I have a feeling that would have been where I went.

Todd Resudek:
Okay. What is the genre of the last song or album you listened to?

Michael Crumm:
Man, I was having trouble with this one, because I had to actually go look it up. So I suppose you would call it Avant-funk. I've been listening to a lot of Talking Heads and ELO and stuff lately. So yeah, so we'll go with Avant-funk, because it's fun to say.

Todd Resudek:
Okay, I've never heard that term before. Did you make that up?

Michael Crumm:
No, no. I went and looked up, I said, "What would you classify Burning Down the House by the Talking Heads?" That was what I got back, so I said, "Okay, I'll take it."

Todd Resudek:
Okay. Today I learned, I've never heard of it before. Avant-funk, very interesting. Is that common that you listen to that or just happened to be the last thing you listened to?

Michael Crumm:
No, funnily enough, that was just the last thing I listened to, but I have been listening to things in that vein a little bit lately. But no, I'll be kind of all over the board. I used to DJ quite a bit when I was in high school and a little bit thereafter, so musically I've kind of been all over the place. But over the last, I don't know, five years or something, really since I ... It's funny, I started working in the music industry and that was about the time I stopped keeping up with music, because I just got way more into work, and so I was really focused on what I was doing and wasn't really listening.
I guess I got old, I just wasn't listening to as much music. That I don't listen to too much new music, but I have a few Spotify playlists that I will keep on heavy rotation. But they're kind of across the board, so a little bit of this and that, here and there.

Todd Resudek:
Okay, cool. So what movie will you watch anytime you come across it on TV?

Michael Crumm:
Oh, man. So there are a few that I watch, not so much on TV, but just I have that I'll watch over and over again. So Hackers is always a good one, that's my favorite. Inception gets a lot of play. I Heart Huckabees is a good one. But I watch a lot more TV, I think, than I do movies.

Todd Resudek:
Interesting. Out of curiosity, I wonder if Hackers appeals to a certain age group. Whereas, I'm really super interested in War Games, which is a similar style of movie, but 10 years earlier.

Michael Crumm:
Sure.

Todd Resudek:
Okay.

Michael Crumm:
Yeah, War Games is great, Real Genius with Val Kilmer is great.

Todd Resudek:
Oh, yeah, man.

Michael Crumm:
[inaudible 00:09:16].

Todd Resudek:
I just quoted that yesterday to my coworkers at stand up and none of them had heard of it before.

Michael Crumm:
Oh, really? Oh man, that's wild. I was down in the Bay at the Exploratorium there by the pier [inaudible 00:09:33] or whatever, by the water where all the famous landmarks are. The Exploratorium, it's like a children's museum and it's really cool. It's all kinds of very unique, different experiments or different things across all kinds of different genres or disciplines, science and stuff.
In this one room off to the side there was a ... it was very smart, the set up, but there was a little box sitting on the table, kind of a long wooden kind of rectangular thing, had two ball bearings in it, and just a little get hints about ... it was something about inspiration or an "Aha" moment, was kind of what the segment was about.
So I grabbed my son, he's just going to turn five this year, and this was, I don't know, it was last fall. I asked him, without really prompting him at all, I was just like, "Hey, take a look at this. How do you think you'd get the balls to either end in the thing?" He kind of looked at it and he kind of rocked it back and forth, and he wasn't sure and he set it on the table. I was like, "Not sure? Nothing, no thoughts?" He kind of looked at it again and went to start to turn his hand like this, like Val Kilmer does with the little toy in Real Genius. I just waited and he did it and he spun it, and he got really excited and I was like, "Ohh."

Todd Resudek:
Nice.

Michael Crumm:
I just kind of had a whole "Aha" moment, like, "Oh, my kid." But he's four, so maybe it's obvious when you're so small that, "Oh, I can spin this thing." But it was awesome, it was a very cool little thing that happened. It made me immediately think of that movie.

Todd Resudek:
Nice. Nice. I-

Michael Crumm:
Anyway.

Todd Resudek:
Yeah, I tend to go to the more R rated parts of the movie, but that's good for you.

Michael Crumm:
Yes, thank you. Well, when you have a five-year-old, it's hard to-

Todd Resudek:
I don't have any excuse. I have a five-year-old, I don't have any excuses.

Michael Crumm:
I just save that for after bedtime.

Todd Resudek:
Cool. All right, so wrapping up, what project are you most excited about working on next?

Michael Crumm:
Sure. Well, obviously still looking to make some improvements in the dashboard, there's a lot of room for improvement there, and obviously looking for contributors there too. So if anyone in your listening audience who's interested in metrics and charts and graphs and all those kind of fun things, wants to make some improvements in the dashboard, that's always welcome. So yeah, there's some things there I would like to see.
I'm working on a project currently, trying to restart a project that was started by [inaudible 00:11:43] on the Phoenix core team any number of months ago, and just trying to revive that a little bit, something that'll help us shuffle bits around a little better. So, I haven't made too much progress there yet, but we're working on it. It's exciting, it's fun to do.

Todd Resudek:
Cool. Well, thanks for joining me today, Michael.

Michael Crumm:
Absolutely, Todd. Thanks so much for having me, this was great.

Todd Resudek:
All right, thanks everybody.
