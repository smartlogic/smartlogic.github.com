Justus Eapen:
Welcome to Elixir Wizards, a podcast brought to you by SmartLogic, a custom web and mobile development shop based out of Baltimore, Maryland. My name is Justus Eapen and I'm joined by my cohost Eric Oestrich, and this is the betweenisode, we're live. I'm also joined by our special guest Saša Jurić. How're you doing Saša?

Saša Jurić:
Yeah, fine thank you very much. How about you?

Justus Eapen:
Doing great. Thank you so much for joining us for our first ever livestream. Coronavirus has got everybody locked down in quarantine, and where are you? Tell us about the situation where you are.

Saša Jurić:
So, I'm in Zagreb, Croatia. It's, I guess, pretty much the same as in the rest of the world. So, we are mostly staying at home, limited movement. Shops are open until 5:00 PM, stuff like that. Corona-wise we're doing actually fine. Our curve is linear and small so far, so that's a good thing. We had some pretty shitty earthquake two weeks ago. The city center has suffered significant damage, so that kind of adds to this whole situation, but we're keeping our spirits high and doing fine so far.

Justus Eapen:
I was saying that's probably pretty scary because Croatia's right next to Italy, and Italy's getting hit really, really hard. Northern Italy especially, so I'm really glad that you're safe and sound. How are you using your time? You must have some extra time being stuck at home all day every day for the indefinite future. How are you passing the time?

Saša Jurić:
Yeah, so before all of this happened like, let's say, maybe we are in this mode three weeks ago, and the week before that it was pretty clear that we're going to enter this social distancing and minimal outside life. And I was thinking, "I'm now going to do a bunch of open source projects and whatnot, now I'm going to have so much time." It didn't really turn out that way. So, I guess for the first two weeks I was frantically refreshing the news and watching the counts and whatnot.
And so, I'm only just getting into... I don't want to call it normal, but some reasonable tempo. I've seen it, or many people mention on Twitter, now a bunch of the world is working remotely, this is really not normal remote or work-from-home mode because the situation's crazy. So, yeah, anyway I've been playing a bit of guitar. Me and my wife have been watching some shows and movies and whatnot, and yeah, that's basically it. And now I'm hoping that I'm finally going to pick up those open source projects I've been working on.

Eric Oestrich:
Yeah, speaking of the remote work, I've got to ask, the green screen behind you, is that inspired by Zoom? Zoom meetings?

Saša Jurić:
No, this is the real green screen. I was actually going to stream from my proper working place, but my wife is in some super marathon debugging session with her colleagues. So, I just went to... This is our bedroom, and so I just parked myself her.

Justus Eapen:
Very cool. So, I'm curious about this earthquake. We've gotten some earthquakes over here in the United States as well in the recent past. The most recent... There's locusts in Africa, the other thing that I've had recently is that we've got some giant Asian hornets invading the United States. Are these the end times?

Saša Jurić:
Yeah, sounds like it, right? It definitely sounds like it.

Justus Eapen:
How do you stay positive? What are you doing to cope with all this? And what do you encourage other people to do, I suppose is the question?

Saša Jurić:
Yeah, that's kind of hard. Everyone has their own mechanisms. So, I've got to say this isn't the worst thing that I've seen in my life. 30 years ago, we had a war here in Croatia, the real stuff with guns and bombs and whatnot. So, that was definitely, at least at this point it seemed it was much more difficult than this stage here. But anyway, even back then and now, I would just say do some stuff to distract you. Whether it's watching some brainwash movie or whatnot, or doing some hobby, reading a book or just doing some programming, coding, or whatever other stuff you want to do. I think it just keeps your mind off of things. You don't frantically refresh the page watching the disease count and whatnot. And so, it kind of keeps you focused, that's how I try to do it.

Eric Oestrich:
I definitely had the, just scrolling through Twitter for 12 hours a day for the first few weeks, and that was partially. I was on paternity leave because we just had our son. 

Saša Jurić:
Oh, wow.

Eric Oestrich:
So, I had copious amounts of free time and then this started. It's like sh, sh, sh, sh, sh was my first few weeks. I was like, "Got to stop this." 

Saša Jurić:
Congratulations then, yeah. Did it happen after we checked last time?

Eric Oestrich:
Yeah, it was right after, or actually at Lonestar. I got a call from my wife at 4:30 in the morning and she's like, "We're having a baby today. Get home."

Saša Jurić:
Wow, that's crazy. It's crazy to think that we had our talk, we recorded our talk two months ago, or less than two months ago, I believe. You probably have the exact date. The world is completely different since then.

Justus Eapen:
That is a fascinating observation actually, the world is completely different. How long do you think it's going to last? Do you think we're going to be here in quarantine for three months? Do you think we're talking a year to 18 months? Is it just the beginning of us becoming mole people?

Saša Jurić:
Yeah, well I hope it's not. I have absolutely no clue, obviously, I'm just like a noob in the area or I have zero knowledge in the area. We are, of course, kind of hoping that it will maybe... Well, what's the word? It will reduce until the summer, but not really go away. And basically, it seems we're all waiting for some sort of vaccine or magical cure, something like that. So, probably a year or so.
I have some events scheduled for June, which I'm 100% certain will not happen. I have some events scheduled for after the summer, and I'm not really sure that even those are going to happen. Well, at least not in real-life form. We're going to see whether people will be doing some virtual conferencing or whatnot. But yeah, we probably have some fun times ahead of us.

Justus Eapen:
And with your work, you've been remote at your company. Is your company full remote? So, has this been a pretty easy transition for them, or is some of the team new to remote working?

Saša Jurić:
So, definitely they allowed and even encouraged working from home, but still a bulk of the people were actually going to the office because they wanted to. Now, obviously, everyone is working from home, and yeah, it's been a little bit of a transitioning phase, but they're doing fine. They're working very hard actually, because Very Big Things in some... Well, a lot of projects that we were working on were tele something, like telehealth, telemedicine, tele education, stuff like that. And now this is becoming more relevant than ever. So, actually, there's more work for Very Big Things, which is a good thing, obviously.

Justus Eapen:
So, that's a great point that I'm curious to follow up on, which is how has this affected your business? So many people have been economically devastated by this thing. I'm curious, it seems like the software business maybe has been not as impacted as badly as the hospitality industry, for example. What's been Very Big Things' experience of it?

Saša Jurić:
Yeah, Very Big Things is doing so far pretty good. We had a meeting, there are no layoffs, there are no cuts or stuff like that. So, obviously, we have to see what's going to happen because no one is isolated in this world. Everything depends on everyone else, so ultimately if the economy goes down for some, this goes down for everyone, right? But we are definitely, I would say, in a place of privilege, so to speak. That we can actually do our job from home, from the comfort of our home and whatnot, and make some decent money of it.
I've seen all over the Twitter, and it's definitely worrying that even people in our industry are getting laid off. I guess, I had no clue, but I wonder what it is for people who have been working in the hospitality industry like Airbnb for example. So, it's definitely worrying, but I guess, you've got to solve one problem at a time, right? So, we've got to survive this thing first, then we're going to think about the economy. Because if we're all dead, then there's no economy anyway.

Justus Eapen:
You're right on about that, and we were hoping to... So, I guess I'll ask you, since we were just talking about work from home. You've worked from home for a long time, you've worked remotely for a long time. Tell us about how you started working from home, and the most important things that you've learned working from home. Things that might be useful to people who are new to it in the recent weeks.

Saša Jurić:
So, I started working six years ago when I, basically, switched from an in-office job to a company from Germany. For the first month or so, it was kind of strange for me because there was no one else around, and I felt isolated. But after that, I've gotten used to it, and now I can't see myself really going to the office anymore. So, there are basic tricks. You've got to still follow your routine, that's what everyone says. So, you basically get out of bed early in the morning. I get out like 6:00 AM or something like that. Me and my wife we make some nice breakfast and then everyone goes to their table.
I try to then try to work as much as I can so I can have free time after, say, 5:00 or 6:00 PM or something like that. Maybe in between I will have a short power nap. Back when things were working, after lunch I would go out. There's a small coffee shop here, and go out and grab some coffee just to be between real people for a change. One cool thing that we did at Aircloak, and this is something I can recommend, is we had random coffee chats, like five-minute chats, remote chats. So, you had on Slack the bot, which pairs the random two people. And then you're supposed to have at least five minutes non-technical discussion.
That was pretty cool because I was working with a team for, I think, almost a year before we actually got to hang out. And I still felt that I knew them already because of all these daily chats, so this is one cool thing. And as many people say, don't work in your pajamas and stuff like that. It kind of keeps you in the momentum.

Justus Eapen:
Yeah, yeah. I'm wearing my marathon shirt because I wanted to remind everyone, this is a marathon not a sprint. It's also just the ugliest shirt of all time. So, we've got one more question for you Saša before we let you go. This is actually from the audience, Todd is asking, "What do you think the future is for online meetups and conferences? Do you think that they will stick around once this thing is over?"

Saša Jurić:
Yeah, that's really hard to say. I mean, definitely things will become more virtual, and maybe they will get more exposure. I think it's pretty cool to have those online events because it gives more opportunity both to speakers and to attendees. On the other hand, it's kind of hard to reserve time for a virtual thing. When you're in there at the event and there's nothing else to do but to actually watch talks and socialize with people. So, I'm hoping that was are going to have both in bigger quantities, but yeah, it's kind of hard to tell what exactly will happen.
Speaking on that note, a week ago we were watching a live virtual concert, so that was pretty cool. Just like you have people coming in this stream, there was like the Postmodern Jukebox, this band, I don't know if you heard of them. A bunch of people are playing in there and each singer or performer would join from their own room, and then they would do three songs, and then there would be another singer, and that was pretty cool. So, it was actually fun. I could see myself watching this even when everything goes back to normal so to speak.

Eric Oestrich:
All right, and one final thing before we swap off, it looks like Justus is muted, but do you have anything that you want to plug before we send you off?

Saša Jurić:
Okay, so now that I have the chance, I'm going to plug my book and Manning. So, Manning is having a promotion, so all the eBooks are, I think, 50% off, and printed books are at 35% off until May the 30th. So, just go to manning.com and add whatever you want. I recommend Elixir in Action, but they actually have a lot of other great books. So yeah, that's one thing that you can keep yourself busy during this lockdown period. 
Otherwise, you may want to check out some of my open source work. I've been working on this library called Boundary, so check that one out. It's, I think, an interesting experiment or project where I'm trying to bring some properties of umbrella applications into a standard project. So, you can have a regular mixed project and you can define who is allowed to call someone else. So, it basically allows you to organize, to give more order into your projects, and I believe that this is a very interesting thing that could prove to be very useful.

Justus Eapen:
Awesome. Saša Jurić, everybody.

Saša Jurić:
Okay, thank you for having me, and yeah, I'm going to look forward to the rest of your guests.

Justus Eapen:
Bruce and Maggie Tate everybody, welcome to the show. How are you doing in these strange times?

Bruce Tate:
I'll let you start that one Maggie.

Maggie Tate:
Okay, I feel like I cry once every day.

Bruce Tate:
Yeah, that's about right. Pretty good otherwise.

Maggie Tate:
Yeah, but we get out, we kayak, we bike, we walk, have to get the dog out.

Bruce Tate:
Probably the coolest thing that's happened was we were out on our kayak, so we were on the river right outside here, and we saw this epic sky battle between a heron and an osprey, which was kind of cool. Then we had to go by where the osprey was and Maggie was looking up and she was swinging her paddle around. It was pretty interesting.

Justus Eapen:
So, are y'all on the water over there, or near it?

Bruce Tate:
Yeah, yeah. We're on a river walk, so it's a bunch of miles of trails, which should be great, but they're closed.

Maggie Tate:
They're closed right now, yeah.

Justus Eapen:
Wow, wow. Yeah, I am also on the water, but it is a completely undeveloped stretch of water. So, I'm basically looking out at jungle and bay, and it's pretty nice.

Maggie Tate:
Sounds beautiful.

Justus Eapen:
Yeah, yeah. I think this is a therapy tip for everybody, which is just get out in nature. It makes everything way, way better if you're able to get out in nature. Highly recommend it. So, that's kind of what we're talking about today is coping strategies, work-from-home tips, we're trying to be encouraging here. I'm sure y'all have been working from home for how long now?

Bruce Tate:
A while.

Justus Eapen:
It was long before this, yeah.

Bruce Tate:
Long time. Gosh, I can't remember the last time that I went into the office every day. Gosh, 20 years ago maybe. Something like that.

Justus Eapen:
So, then you probably have some advice for people who are just getting started in the last few weeks. Anything immediately come to mind as especially important?

Bruce Tate:
Yeah, yeah. So, a couple of things. One of the things that Groxio was really about is the idea that as a society we are asking more and more of our digital workers, and so we're kind of getting carpal tunnel of the brain, if that makes any sense. That we basically ramp people up until they get really good at what they're doing, and then basically get more and more productivity out of them. And our brains aren't built to work that way.
So, we think it's really important to basically take your regular breaks and do things like that, but also take a mental break to work on technical problems that are difficult and different from what you're used to. To basically get back into the learner's mind. It was really interesting. So, Justus, I know you were emceeing at Lonestar, Lonestar Elixir, yeah, and the Thomases really crystallized our marketing message. We had Zach Thomas, Dave's son, and Dave's talk was okay too.
He talked about the Dreyfus learning model where we want to knock ourselves down to beginner and then advance to an expert. And Dave believes, and I agree that, that's kind of the most critical skill. We don't care if it's Groxio or anything else, but we think that working problems outside of your every day job, it's really important. Whether it's a Sudoku or some kind of a puzzle. I like learning languages. I'm kind of partial to that. Any of that stuff works, and we tell our mentees a lot of the same. How about you Maggie?

Maggie Tate:
I find it's really important to sign off, right? That there should be a clear start to the day and a clear end to the day, so that it just doesn't drag on and on and on into the evening hours, but I actually [crosstalk 00:16:29]-

Eric Oestrich:
I'm so bad at [inaudible 00:16:29].

Maggie Tate:
I know, me too. So, I bought myself a Kindle because I couldn't put my phone down, right? So, I'm checking Twitter, I'm checking email and I was like since I don't have the self-discipline to not, I think I just need a different device in my hand. So, I throw it away at about 10:00. It's a little late, and then I pick up the Kindle and I don't look at anything else again until about 7:30 in the morning.

Justus Eapen:
I feel seen. You've seen directly to me. So, I wanted to get a little bit specific here about the skill, the sort of knocking yourself down to the beginner level. This is such a great time for that, not necessarily just in our professional development, but in our personal development. What are you guys working on? Any new hobbies or things like that?

Bruce Tate:
So, at Groxio we're kind of working through Elixir. We just finished with Prolog and before that it was a language called Pony. I think all of those are great languages to teach people interesting things, and one of the things that we tried to do with Elixir, since a lot of our users come from there, they're our people. We're trying to stay in places where Elixir developers have blind spots. Things like processes, native process abstractions and streams, macros and sigils and all these little tips that people really kind of need.
So, in the Elixir space that's a good one. In Prolog build a MACE, navigator MACE. I think that those are great ones. And what about new recipes Maggie? What are some of those-

Maggie Tate:
Yeah, I'm cooking. So, right now I've got some curry pockets that I've started to cook upstairs. It's got some potato and chickpea and curry paste and coconut stuff. So, I'll make some pie crust and wrap those up and bake them, and I'm going to make some naan later today. So, I'm getting to work out of the kitchen and I kind of wish there was some Nerves project that could lock my pantry door. Anybody out there?

Bruce Tate:
Oh yeah. [crosstalk 00:18:25] I tell you.

Eric Oestrich:
Those sound amazing, yeah.

Justus Eapen:
Yeah, the Indian half of me is 100% onboard for Indian recipes and food in general. I've been talking to Eric about my Bulgogi obsession, which is the current only thing I'm eating while I work on that recipe. What else do we have here? We've got so much to talk about.
So, first of all, I have been actually following along with Programmer Passport. It's awesome seeing it come out. Bruce, I told you I'm doing some writing on Elixir right now, and so you have been just a tremendous source of inspiration. I was reading your... This isn't from Groxio, but your Designing Elixir Systems with OTP book, so beautifully written, really, really, really helpful. How far along are you in Elixir or Groxio? I think you've got maybe three or four modules at this point, is that right? For Elixir?

Bruce Tate:
Yeah, basically, this particular release, this language is going to have eight different chapters with it. So, we're about to release five and six of those, and then seven and eight. So, these two will be key value, whether it's keywords or maps or structs. And then also, we're getting into processes. We don't get to OTP until the next language. We're kind of treating that as a language because it's not a language, but this really is its own paradigm. It has its own patterns and things like that.
We just wrote the book, so rather than write a lot for that, we'll write some. We'll write some chapters for it, but kind of take a tack that Designing Elixir Systems didn't. But we will focus that on video, and basically applying the patterns in that book to a lot of different pieces. So, that will be a lot of fun, and your followers that have not yet jumped on programming passport, the ninja move is to get either the monthly or yearly subscriptions. Because the language itself, this is our first one that after we pass the subscription enrollment period. Monthly right now it's 15 bucks, and yearly it's a little bit less than that and you get to keep it forever. So, it's definitely the way to buy it.

Eric Oestrich:
So, we have a question from the audience. Where's your dog?

Bruce Tate:
On the floor.

Maggie Tate:
She's here.

Bruce Tate:
Yeah, let's see if we can-

Maggie Tate:
Yeah.

Bruce Tate:
Yeah, right there. [inaudible 00:20:42]. It's funny, when I wrote... I wrote for Manning, and by the way, Saša's book is definitely the best Manning book Elixir book ever written. Might be the best Elixir book ever written, it's my favorite and probably James's too. But when I wrote for Manning the first time, the first thing that I tried to do is open learning channels and talk about things that are not technology. And my development editor, [inaudible 00:21:08] he kind of hated it. He fought me tooth and nail, but we came to an understanding.
So, the dog on the floor is our attempt to bring some of our personality and our sense of place and home to the recordings.

Maggie Tate:
What's funny is that if she doesn't make it in when Bruce is doing some of the recordings, I find her outside the door laying down wishing she was inside the room.

Bruce Tate:
And if my headphones are off, she will knock on the door. She will go tap, tap. Not scratching, just kind of tap, tap. Just politely-

Justus Eapen:
She noticed.

Eric Oestrich:
That's amazing.

Justus Eapen:
Dogs are... We don't deserve them.

Maggie Tate:
Yeah.

Eric Oestrich:
To go back a bit, Todd also brought up, "If you need someone to do Nerves for locking your pantry, maybe you can get John Carstens to sign up for that."

Bruce Tate:
The royal bank of John John. Maggie just edited that talk, I think.

Maggie Tate:
Yeah, I did. It was a great talk. We just released it this week.

Eric Oestrich:
Yeah, that was fun to watch.

Justus Eapen:
So, we want to give you the final word, chance to plug anything you want, any shameless self-promotion. I am a huge fan of Programmer Passport. Like I said, I've been referring to that as I've been developing my own writing on Elixir, and also your other books Bruce. Anything else that you want to talk about or share with the audience or encourage the audience to do?

Bruce Tate:
Yeah, there are a lot of things happening right now. So, the main ones are programmer passports happening. Of course, the book with James. I mean, that's one of the best writing experiences of my life with seven languages, just because James is such a brilliant person. And working with him where I could focus on the language and he could focus on the message was just tremendous.
But probably the main things are we are really dependent on our conferences, and so, if we need to, we will take Gig City Elixir online this year. It's definitely happening, it's October the 23rd and 24th. We already have a lanyard sponsor, so thanks to-

Maggie Tate:
GetThru.

Bruce Tate:
GetThru, yeah. Real excited to have them on board, and at the same time Lonestar Elixir is definitely happening. We have Programmer Passport, and also, we are really excited to be offering at our conference training prices, very small team courses. And this is only through coronavirus because it's really not cost effective for us. But we have our live view class, it's two-and-a-half days. It's April 29th through May 1st, and it works out to about 400 bucks a day, which is what conference prices are, and the class goes on for two-and-a-half days. If you want to join us, we'd love to have you. Come to grox.io to sign up.

Justus Eapen:
All right, Bruce and Maggie Tate everybody. Thank you so much for joining us on the betweenisode. Hello James, how are you?

James Edward Gray:
I'm doing good, how about yourself?

Justus Eapen:
Well, I'm so glad to finally meet you. Thank you for coming on the show.

James Edward Gray:
Yeah, absolutely. Thanks for inviting me.

Justus Eapen:
First of all, where are you calling us from?

James Edward Gray:
I'm in Oklahoma, so right about in the middle of the US.

Justus Eapen:
Perfect, so that means you are far away from the worst of this crisis that we're experiencing. How are you holding up during this time?

James Edward Gray:
Good, I actually really enjoy watching you ask everyone that, because when Saša was like, "Oh, I had all these grand plans, and then for two weeks I just read the news." I was like, "Oh man, it's not just me. Great."

Justus Eapen:
Yeah. Personally, this week was like the first time I got over the crisis mentality and was able to be like, "Okay, you know what? This is just life, life goes on and I've got work to do, so I'm over it. It's done for me." How about you? Are you beyond the crisis mentality?

James Edward Gray:
Yeah, I think so. In the first two weeks the one good thing was I was working on a really, really hard thing at work. And so, I was just neck deep in that and trying to get through it. So, I did have the distraction of work, which was pretty good that in the off hours I was definitely just, "Oh my gosh," reading everything. And now I'm starting to feel like you. I'm like, "Okay, this will pass." And now I'm getting around to doing some other things, which feels really good.

Justus Eapen:
Good, yeah. Sometimes really, really hard things are good.

Eric Oestrich:
Yeah, last night was the first time I programmed on a side project in a month-and-a-half. So, it's definitely good to get back to normal as much as you can.

James Edward Gray:
Agreed.

Justus Eapen:
So, we were just talking to Bruce and Maggie Tate, and I kind of want to linger on a subject that came up because you know Bruce and Maggie Tate, they run Groxio, which is an educational platform for learning programming languages. And so, the audience in the Twitch stream were suggesting languages, and I think the most interesting language to come up was COBOL. Did you see that article that came out that said all the states are looking for COBOL programmers to update their HR and unemployment systems?

James Edward Gray:
Yeah, I saw that. Actually, a couple of friends of mine were texting it to me and we were talking about it.

Justus Eapen:
What's your take there?

James Edward Gray:
I would say it proves that COBOL has really lasted, right? I can't believe how well it's done over time. I don't know, it's really cool. I think a lot of people talk about, "Oh, it should be updated and built into new things," which is probably true because it's just been... Not because there's anything wrong with COBOL, but because there's been enough time that you could probably learn from the changes that have happened in the world since then, and build more modern and on target things would be my guess. But yeah, it doesn't really inspire me to run out and want to write a lot of COBOL or anything.

Justus Eapen:
Oh, because that's what I was kind of wondering is, are any developers out there like, "Oh snap, this is an opportunity. I'm going to go learn COBOL and work on COBOL"?

James Edward Gray:
I don't know. I don't know, that's a good question. Maybe if you need a job.

Justus Eapen:
I won't make any jokes about that.

James Edward Gray:
I know, right?

Justus Eapen:
So, I'm looking at your site, Gray Soft. Talk a little bit about your experience, because a lot of your material here is about Ruby. I'm curious about your experience coming to Elixir.

James Edward Gray:
Oh, yeah. Jeez, coming to Elixir, that is... I was in Ruby for ever and ever, I still use Ruby every day and I use Ruby. But I think Joe Armstrong published his book Programming Erlang, and I tried, and it just didn't take. I played with it for a while and tried it around, but it didn't really take, and I was on this job where a friend of mine that I worked with, Nathan Long, was telling me, "The problem is we're trying to do this in Ruby, and this is really an Elixir problem." And I'm like, "Oh, whatever," and I was ignoring him.
And then later, I ended up finally sitting down and learning some Elixir and learning that Nathan was exactly right, that it was an Elixir problem. And needing to do several things concurrently, of course, and know when things start and stop and finish and stuff like that. So, yeah, after that, we started using Elixir on a couple of sites, and I really loved the way it let me write web apps, but stay stateful. Not have to forget everything every time and do 30 queries to remember where I was and stuff like that. So, that's what kind of hooked me.

Justus Eapen:
So, how long ago was that? How long have you been... Are you primarily Elixir? You said you write Ruby every day, so I'm curious what the split is.

James Edward Gray:
Yeah. Well, I work at a company where we have a big Rails monolith, and then we have several services on the side all written in Elixir. So, I use both about equally right now, I would say. But then if I program for fun, I generally do it in Elixir.

Justus Eapen:
Rock and roll. Are you an experienced work-from-home person? Or is this-

James Edward Gray:
Yeah.

Justus Eapen:
Yeah?

James Edward Gray:
Yeah, I've worked from home for coming around on 20 years now. So, this is not new to me. My day-to-day hasn't changed that much except my wife and kid are here more often. 

Justus Eapen:
Do you have any tips for people who are either new to working from home or new to having their families at home while they're working from home?

James Edward Gray:
Yeah, so other people have covered the work-from-home tips well, so I'll take a different angle to it. If you have young kids, you're dealing with this new thing called homeschooling, which of course, people know how to do it very well. But I've had a little fun with that as far as working with my daughter and working on her math and stuff. I've kind of taken that different approach, and I sat down with her and we're learning to ray trace together.

Justus Eapen:
Yes.

James Edward Gray:
Isn't that great? Yeah, ray tracing is so much fun. It teaches you math, it's great, and I'm a total jerk. I could have just given her Blender or something, and instead I grabbed POV-Ray, which if you don't know, is a command-line ray tracer that you write scenes in this scene description language. It's literally a programming language that you write these scenes in, and then you feed it to this command-line program and it renders a picture. But it's awesome because you can use For loops and goes like that to build scenes. It's amazing. We're having a blast.

Justus Eapen:
POV-Ray.

James Edward Gray:
Yeah, POV-Ray. It stands for Persistence of Vision ray tracing.

Eric Oestrich:
There's also a pretty great talk of someone doing... From Lonestar someone did a ray tracing on Elixir.

James Edward Gray:
Yeah, I know. Everybody keeps telling me, I never see that talk. I don't think it's online yet. I missed Lonestar because... I really wanted to come down. It's in my backyard, and I almost always go down when they're in Texas. But my daughter had a Odyssey of the Mind competition at 6:45 the next morning. It was like, "I'm not driving back all night and then getting up at 5:00."

Justus Eapen:
That talk was one of the best, it was Jason Stewart. It was one of the best conference talks I've ever seen, one of the best educational experience. Just one of the best explanations of a complex subject I've ever seen. It was like TED Talk quality, absolutely outrageously good. Super duper looking forward to that coming out.

Eric Oestrich:
It'll be the next one that's coming out goes Maggie. But yeah, so you also wanted to talk about the general solution versus the specifics. Do you want to rant about that a bit?

James Edward Gray:
Oh yeah. Yeah, this is your... You're talking about season four is going to be service and application architecture, right? Or something like that. I was reading that post from José about the authentication PR that he made for Phoenix, how do you add authentication to your app? And he hits on something great in there, which I think we don't talk about enough, and I would love to hear an episode about, which is, we always say things like newer programmer might say, "Oh, I'm going to write my own background processing whatever for this app."
And then a lot of times more experienced programmers say, "Careful there, here be dragons. You have to think of this and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, right?" Lots of things. And I think the trick there is that we're talking about two different things. The specific solution that meets your app or the general solution that is like the background processing library for any application, right? And the general solution does have to worry about all those things. But in the specific solution for just your app, you know what you need and what axes you can afford to ignore, and you can do simpler things that way.

Justus Eapen:
So, this doesn't sound so much like a heuristic, like always opt for this one or the other. It sounds more like a framework for thinking about whether or not to adopt a library into your application.

James Edward Gray:
Yeah, I think that's totally right. Obviously, there are times when you want to mkt trade-off. I don't think very many of us think, "Oh, I'll row my own web server and HTTP parser or anything like that." We grab Rails, we grab Phoenix, right? And there's totally times when you should make that trade off. Like security library if you're doing hashing passwords and stuff like that. Don't write that yourself because it's dangerous, right? You could make a lot of mistakes.
But a lot of times I think we too quickly grab the general solution, and then accept the massive amount of complexity that comes with it when our specific need could be more easily addressed.

Justus Eapen:
Well, you are definitely speaking to something that I think about a lot and care a lot about, and I'd love to have you back on in season four to talk more about application system architecture. Before we let you go, do you have any final plugs or asks for the audience?

James Edward Gray:
I do have a plug, and I'm going to switch and plug Eric's thing ExVenture. It's amazing. I've known it's existed for a long time, but I've actually just gotten into reading it, and I hear people on Elixir forums say, "We need some big full Phoenix apps that we can look at and see how they work. We need to see how to do web admin stuff, admin interfaces. We need to see how a real OTP app works." All of these things exist and it's in one repo called ExVenture.
It's super cool. If you want good starting points for just reading it, jump into the game room class. If you've ever played with a MUD, this is like things you know from a MUD like pickup, drop-off, but it's an OTP gen_server. These are like call actions on the gen_server. It's amazing, or look at the command system, which uses a very simple macro to parse the incoming commands. It's really well done. I'm having a total blast reading this code.

Eric Oestrich:
Well, thanks for that plug.

James Edward Gray:
No, it's worth it.

Justus Eapen:
And thank you for joining us on the betweenisode. James Edward Gray, everybody.

James Edward Gray:
Absolutely. Thanks, Justus.

Justus Eapen:
The plug, I guess, for that artist. His name is Jesse Link, he is in Pike Place Market, his studio is there. He does all this great surreal street art inspired art that always has animals involved. And this one I particularly like just because of the symbolism of basically man was a monkey before he ate the apple type of thing. And I thought that, that was really deep. I always buy art when I'm traveling, but it's always for my mom because she's got a house and I move around a lot. But this time I was like, that's for me, this one's for me.
Everybody, we're joined by the Freezes. Jim Freeze and Chris Freeze. So, excited to have you both on. Jim is the organizer of ElixirConf. This isn't offensive, but you're one of the elder statespeople of the industry. You're like the Benjamin Franklin of the Elixir World. So, we're super glad to have Jim on, and your son Chris Freeze, who's at all the conferences, and has recently, I guess in the last several months started a job, a new job. I don't know if you're allowed to talk about it, maybe we don't have to, but we're super-

Chris Freeze:
Oh, yeah. I can talk about it.

Justus Eapen:
So, yeah. Tell us about your new gig, Chris.

Chris Freeze:
Yeah, so I was hired at PepsiCo eCommerce. I've been there for about a month now.

Justus Eapen:
And it must be going well over here.

Chris Freeze:
Well, this is just casual, so I'm not going to talking about anything that we're doing at PepsiCo eCommerce, but I can at least say that I work there.

Justus Eapen:
Awesome, and where are you both calling us from? You look like you're in different places.

Jim Freeze:
I'm in Prosper, Texas, up the Dallas area.

Chris Freeze:
And I'm still in Austin.

Justus Eapen:
Prosper, Texas. Does Texas do this on purpose? They just have also the best names of towns and stuff like that. Is that a thing?

Jim Freeze:
It's a good town name, right? Little Prosper here.

Eric Oestrich:
Texas, and the other good ones are in Pennsylvania.

Chris Freeze:
Texas likes to steal names from European countries. We've got Paris, Texas, and also, I always see Italy, Texas, driving from Dallas to Austin.

Justus Eapen:
Italy, Texas.

Chris Freeze:
Italy, Texas.

Eric Oestrich:
Indiana has Peru, Indiana. That's the only one that pops into my mind, but there's definitely Indiana does the same. So, it seems like a Midwest, Southern, I guess, thing to do.

Justus Eapen:
So, we've been trying to be encouraging to people during this time. I think there's a lot of stress in general, so we're trying to bring people the good news. How are you guys making good use of the time? Have you picked up any new hobbies in this weird stay at home environment?

Jim Freeze:
I would say, for us, this seems like this is just business as usual because I work from home anyway.

Chris Freeze:
Yeah, I've been working remotely for pretty much the last four years. But I will say this, the gyms being closed has kind of put a wrench in a lot of my normal daily routines.

Justus Eapen:
And what about the generalized psychic angst? That hasn't impacted you guys? You haven't had to deal with that at all?

Jim Freeze:
So, my daughter and son-in-law are with us now. They were going to college and they shut down classes and they closed graduation, so they said there's no need to live in the college town, so they moved in with us. So, it's kind of fun, we do walks in the afternoon and cook dinner and have good family conversation. I'd say I've been doing walks every morning too because I can't go to the gym either. But it's kind of nice meeting my neighbors. Just like the first day of shutdown it's like, "Oh, he's here. I've never seen him before."

Eric Oestrich:
I can also confirm that our neighborhood has approximately four to five times the amount of walkers than normal.

Jim Freeze:
Oh, yeah. Well, today is day 25 of the shutdown, right? So, 365 days a year, it's only 25 days come on.

Justus Eapen:
Yeah, walks are so hot right now. I've seen more people walking than ever before. Eric said this, he's like, "I saw someone walking. They look like they had never went for a walk in their life or something like that." I was trying to picture what it would look like for someone to be unaccustomed, I guess, to taking a walk.

Jim Freeze:
It's a good mental health thing, put on some headphones or something and listen to a good podcast or something.

Justus Eapen:
And also, all the families walking together, it's really sweet to see. So, you guys are both veteran work-from-homers, workers-from-home. I'm curious, everyone's been giving tips and tricks, that kind of thing. We hear a lot of the same things, which I think is actually good because it reinforces it. I'm curious, what are your must-do, must-have items, tips, tasks for working from home.

Chris Freeze:
I'm probably not the best person to ask because I imagine that a lot of the tips and tricks that a lot of people use, I just don't use at all. My main thing from working from home is that mini fridge right there. That's pretty much all I need, and I'm just good to go.

Justus Eapen:
What do you keep in it?

Chris Freeze:
Right now, I've got a lot of Mountain Dew Zero.

Justus Eapen:
That's a programmer, Mountain Dew. What about you Jim?

Jim Freeze:
Probably optimizing my energy, doing a lot of that. It's nice to not have like, oh, you've got to get something done in a certain amount of time, right? Because I consider programming more like an Olympic sport instead of an hourly wage job. If you're tired, if you can't think, you can't think, right? It doesn't do you any good if you're sleepy or tired, to try to code and solve a problem. So, basically, maximizing my energy.

Eric Oestrich:
It's definitely inefficient.

Jim Freeze:
It's like I was working on this problem last night, I was up until 2:00 AM, and then I'm up at 8:00 AM this morning back on solving the problem. It was like, "This is cool, I've never done this before."

Justus Eapen:
I love this because Maggie, who was just on, like a few guests back, she said, "You've got to have a start time and a stop time." And I was like, "Yeah, my start time is when I wake up, and my stop time is when I drop dead." What do you mean?

Eric Oestrich:
That's a good way to put it.

Justus Eapen:
Definitely much healthier to be like, "Okay, every day at 6:00 I'm done." No, I just-

Jim Freeze:
I know people who do that. I can't turn it off like that. Maybe I'm too OCD.

Justus Eapen:
Yeah, and also sometimes there are just needs. We have a client who was just was tearing out their whole search and replacing their whole search and they needed it done by today. And I was like, "I have to get this done. So, I'm just going to stay up until it's done. And it's done, and here I am."
We want to give you guys a chance to sort of... Jim, you've got ElixirConf. I'm really curious what's your outlook on this year for ElixirConf? This is a great time to get out in front of it for the Elixir people. I'm curious, how are you thinking about it?

Jim Freeze:
Ooh, that's a tough question right now.

Justus Eapen:
You can also dodge it.

Jim Freeze:
I really want to have the conference, but the Gaylord's closed down right now.

Justus Eapen:
Yeah.

Jim Freeze:
So, it's hard for me to sell tickets when the venue's shut down. And then we don't know what protocols we're going to have when it opens up. Are we going to have to be further apart and have less density? I've got several sponsors already lined up, PepsiCo's a sponsor, the The RealReal's a sponsor, and DNSimple's a sponsor, but I really don't want to return money, right? So, I don't want to collect it, but I will if I have to.
So, right now we're not going forward with our current contract because I don't think it's valid anymore, especially with the hotel being closed. But the hotel's not even talking to us because if your event is not two months out, they've got to shuffle everybody they have, right? So, it's some challenging times right now, very challenging. I'm hoping for the best, and we hope to have a conversation with them at the end of April, and you can see on Elixir Radar that we're continuing and we're planning on it, but you won't know for sure until the tickets go on sale. If the tickets go on sale, it's going to happen.

Eric Oestrich:
So, Todd has asked, "Will you do ElixirConf 2021 in Aurora if it doesn't happen this year?"

Jim Freeze:
So, that's a possibility, right? That's what they're doing with a lot of things is they're extending it. So, our option would be to just cancel it. Just claim force majeure and say we're not going back. I've got another location I'm already looking at for 2021, but I haven't signed because they're shutdown too. And so, yeah, that's about two days ago, we just created ElixirConfV, so we're actually going to start running some virtual conferences.

Justus Eapen:
Chris, are you helping out with that?

Chris Freeze:
As much as I can.

Eric Oestrich:
Is there a website for ElixirConfV that we can send people to yet?

Jim Freeze:
Not yet. We'll be selling tickets through, probably ElixirConf and ElixirConfEU for starters, but it's not as if they're going to buy that domain name.

Chris Freeze:
Yeah, like right this second.

Eric Oestrich:
Yeah, you've got about five minutes before someone has it.

Justus Eapen:
So, we're running out of time here. I want to give you all the last word. Jim, I just want to let you know we are rooting for you here. Keep us appraised, and if there's anything that we can do to support you, the Elixir community definitely standards behind ElixirConf. It's been great to us and we'd love to be great back to you. Do you have any final plugs, asks for the audience?

Jim Freeze:
We've just created a website called teslacarlot.com, and it's basically for users to sell and buy their Teslas person-to-person and person-to-dealership. It'll be feature complete today, and we'll probably launch it on Monday or early next week.

Justus Eapen:
Oh my gosh this is awesome. I had ordered a Model 3 and coronavirus hit a couple days before it was delivered. And so, I was like, "Never mind, I'll eat the $100 application fee and save the $60,000." Okay, and what about you, Chris? Any final plugs, asks for the audience? By the way Chris, we'd love to have you on in season four if you be back on to talk about some architecture and application architecture.

Chris Freeze:
Yeah, I'd love to be back on. Might have to confirm some things first, but yeah, definitely want to talk you about that. Just support ElixirConf, support TeslaCarLot, and PepsiCo eComm is hiring Elixir and React developers. So, apply.

Justus Eapen:
Apply to Pepsi, they've got lots of really great people over there. I love David Antaramian? Do I have that-

Chris Freeze:
Yeah, David Antaramian, or I probably got his name wrong too. Sorry, David.

Justus Eapen:
He's a great guy.

Chris Freeze:
He's cool.

Justus Eapen:
I had him on the show. Shout out David, hope you're doing well. All right, the Freezes, thank you so much for being on. We want to do this again with you real soon, and stay safe out there in coronavirus land.

Jim Freeze:
Thank you.

Eric Oestrich:
We were just talking about potential demise in interpersonal touch in our civilization. Dan [Endbeard 00:46:45] says, it's easy to measure the pros of stopping touching people. I imagine it's much harder to measure the detriment to society you might incur from removing human touch.

Justus Eapen:
Wise words from the audience, in my opinion. What do you guys think? Do you think that a year from now no one will be shaking hands or giving each other hugs and we'll just be like a bunch of atomistic automatons wearing masks and hiding from the world?

Frank:
I hope not.

Eric Oestrich:
It would be like me at Lonestar. I was touching elbows with everybody because I was sick and didn't want to spread it [inaudible 00:47:24].

Justus Eapen:
I remember you were doing that, and the thing is we knew about this at that point. I remember thinking like, "You know, this might be one of the last things that we do together for a while." I'm really glad that we did it. It was just such a [crosstalk 00:47:40]-

Eric Oestrich:
Yeah, when I flew, I wore a mask while flying because we were about to have a kid and did have a kid during Lonestar. So, I guess I also appreciate the elbow bumps.

Justus Eapen:
Frank, how are you hanging in right now? Are you picking up any new hobbies or finding any new coping mechanisms?

Frank:
I wish I could say I've been doing anything not work-wise. It seems like work has picked up at the moment, and certainly family's at home, it's been keeping me busy.

Justus Eapen:
Any tips for working from home with family around?

Frank:
So, you're asking the person who works from a windowless office in a basement. So, I'm not quite sure my tips apply to a lot of that.

Eric Oestrich:
I'm also in a windowless office in the basement.

Frank:
Oh, awesome. Then you understand how nice it can be to just totally be isolated from the rest of the world.

Eric Oestrich:
It's just always this bright.

Frank:
Yes, always this bright, morning, night. I guess work-wise it hasn't switched too much from my normal state since I work from home down here. But certainly, the ability to escape and take a break. I should say I feel grateful that my family's all healthy, so those things come first. But it definitely is a switch for now. It's a little bit stressful times too.

Justus Eapen:
So, work's picking up for you. Work has kind of been picking up for us too. How do you deal with it? When so many people are struggling out there, and especially, this seems like a Matthew principle type of thing where those who have nothing, everything will be taken away, those who have everything, more will be given. That's kind of how it feels to me right now. Are you struggling with that at all, or have you thought about it?

Frank:
A little bit. I'd also point out there's a lot of stress. People are on edge, a lot of other things going on in people's lives that we just have to work around at the moment. Just putting up a lot more stress that those of us who are in a position to help out with that need to take a little bit of extra time. So, I'm not completely sure it's the extra work, but more like there's so much stuff going on, and different things that we just have to accommodate right now that's been keeping me a little bit busier. Right now, I'm working on getting some stuff built at a factory, which has been kind of interesting logistically.

Eric Oestrich:
Is that the smart rent devices? Are those-

Frank:
Yeah, yeah. So, we're getting the US, but things are shut down a lot, so we're trying to figure out how to make things move forward at least in some sense that's safe for everyone is tricky.

Justus Eapen:
Well, listen we got a little bit of a late start here. I want to give you the chance to have a final word, any shameless self-promotion, plugging, anything you want to plug. I also want to ask you if you'd do me a favor and shame Justin Schneck for not responding to my email to come on this show.

Frank:
Well, okay. I can do that for sure, but I'm going to plug something that he has a lot of involvement with, so it's... Oh, this is live, so don't go out tweeting about this yet, but it's live so they can't keep it secret forever. The Nerves Project website looks a little nicer if you go to www.nerves-project.org. Justin-

Eric Oestrich:
Sorry, I have a complaint to register, my connection might not be private.

Frank:
Yeah, yeah. There are some bugs, that's why they probably told me not to publicize this too much. So, among all of us, if you go to www.nerves-project.org and take a look. So, Justin works with Very, the consultancy now. Him and others they were working with just did a beautiful job updating the website. And there are a few things that we're going to add in the coming weeks. Justin's super excited that they've freshened up [crosstalk 00:51:39]-

Eric Oestrich:
The other thing is they need to set up the http no www nerves-project goes to a 404 page.

Frank:
Yeah, I think that might be my problem. Yes.

Justus Eapen:
Well, Frank, thank you so much for coming on the betweenisode.

Frank:
Yeah, thanks for having me.

Justus Eapen:
[crosstalk 00:51:56] having you back on in season four to talk about system and application architecture, so we'll reach out to you shortly. I'm also going to sign off here so that a few more guests can join, and I'm looking forward to seeing Elixir Wizards and Outlaws Chapter Two on the betweenisode. Thanks a lot Frank, see you later.

Frank:
Okay, see you.

Justus Eapen:
This has been part one of the Elixir Wizards betweenisode. We will be back at you in a couple of days with part two of the betweenisode.
