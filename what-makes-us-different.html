    <h2>The 4 Pillars of Smartlogic</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <h3>High-Quality Body of Work</h3>
        <p class="lead">At Smartlogic, we’re focused on building smarter software for every client. With that goal in mind, we’ve built web applications for DinnerTime, added new software features for Brookes Publishing and created APIs, iPhone apps, and Android apps for lots of exciting startups. We’ve also done impressive work for Exxon Mobile, Johns Hopkins University, and JP Morgan.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Effective Tailored Process</h3>
        <p class="lead">While we have a methodical process, we also realize that every client needs a process that is custom tailored to deliver the most successful project possible. With every project, we’re focused on results and getting real features in front of our clients as quickly as possible.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Culture of Communication and Transparency</h3>
        <p class="lead">With Smartlogic, you have direct access to the developers working on your project. In addition to the standard daily standups, weekly iterations, and epic meetings, we take it a step further. We share every single document with our clients, provide running iteration meeting documents, and have three levels of our team involved in projects. So, you’ll never have to call us to ask where your project stands.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>True Team Approach</h3>
        <p class="lead">Everyone on our team is smart and talented in their own right. But when we come together to work on projects, we’re even stronger than the sum of our parts. By combining different skill sets and experiences, we have assembled a team that has all the expertise needed to ensure your project is a success from start to completion.</p>
