        <p><a href="https://askarbit.com/">Arbit</a> is a Baltimore-based  competitive intelligence startup that helps small and medium enterprises understand their target market.</p>

        <p>Arbit's relationship with SmartLogic began as their product was transitioning from a social mobile app to a survey and analytics platform. As they were heading into a development-intensive phase in their company's growth, they knew they wanted to bring a technical team member on, but didn't have the background or expertise to ensure their new team member's success. They reached out to SmartLogic for consulting support and advice on hiring an in-house developer and planning their new product roadmap.</p>

        <p>The leadership team at SmartLogic helped Arbit with their hiring process by vetting and interviewing developer applicants, and ultimately recommending the developer that Arbit hired. SmartLogic also worked with the co-founders at Arbit to build their product roadmap, providing guidance on infrastructure choices, feature complexity, and sequencing. SmartLogic's Director of Development Operations Dan Ivovich also served as a mentor and advisor for Arbit's new developer, providing feedback and guidance on a weekly basis and helping her apply strategy to code.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>As founders, you are good at being visionaries—but directing the technical implementation of that vision is a very different set of skills.
          — Alex Bullington, Co-CEO and Founder, Arbit</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>For Arbit, working with SmartLogic provided security and confidence that their product roadmap was sound, and would support the kind of growth and scale they were aiming for. It also allowed them to make better use of the round of capital they had recently raised, while still knowing that they were building in a scalable way.  As Alex put it, “Development is expensive—it’s even more expensive to build the wrong thing. It’s so helpful to get someone to guide you in the right way and help you take the right steps in product development.”</p>
